# Data Extraction & Integration Project - Assignment 1

## Overview
This project is a part of the coursework for Data Extraction & Integration. It includes a comprehensive approach to redesigning a database schema, querying the database, and extracting data using Python.

## Team Members 
- Dimitrios Diamantidis
- Johan Hensman
- Nicky Schilperoort

## Project Structure

### Task 1: Database (Re)Design
- Redesign of database schema to include new attributes and relationships that enhance data extraction capabilities.
- Introduction of new entities such as `borrows`, `provides`, and `account` to establish clear relations between `branch`, `customer`, and `loan`.

### Task 2: Querying the Database
- Implementation of SQL queries to perform complex data retrieval such as finding branch information for each account, calculating the average loan per branch, and identifying customers with the highest balance.

### Task 3: Data Extraction and Entity Resolution using Python
- Python scripts for database connection, running queries, and data extraction.
- Methods to transform database tables into dataframes and compute similarities between records using Jaccard similarity.

## Technologies Used
- SQL
- Python
- Libraries: SQLite3, Pandas
